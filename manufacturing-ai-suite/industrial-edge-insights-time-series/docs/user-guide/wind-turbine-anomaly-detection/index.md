This sample app demonstrates a time series use case by detecting anomalous power generation
patterns in wind turbines, relative to wind speed. By identifying deviations, it helps
optimize maintenance schedules and prevent potential turbine failures, enhancing
operational efficiency.

In this article, you can learn about the architecture of the sample and its data flow.

If you want to start working with it, instead, check out the
[Get Started Guide](../get-started.md) or [How-to Guides](../how-to-guides/index.md)
for Time-series applications.

## How It Works

As seen in the following architecture diagram, the sample app at a high-level comprises data
simulators (which can act as data destinations, if configured) - in the real world these would
be the physical devices, the generic Time Series AI stack based on **TICK Stack** comprising
of Telegraf, InfluxDB, and the Time Series Analytics microservice using Kapacitor and Grafana.

### Data flow explanation

Below is an explanation of how this architecture translates to data flow in the wind turbine
anomaly detection use case, in which the data is ingested using the OPC-UA server/MQTT publisher
simulators and anomaly alerts are published to a OPC-UA server/MQTT broker.

#### **Data Sources**

The demonstration uses the dataset contained in `wind-turbine-anomaly-detection.csv`, which is
a normalized version of an open source wind turbine dataset (`T1.csv`), as retrieved from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkerisen/wind-turbine-scada-dataset).

This data is ingested into **Telegraf** through the **OPC-UA** protocol using the **OPC-UA** data simulator OR **MQTT** protocol using the MQTT publisher data simulator.

#### **Data Ingestion**

**Telegraf** through its input plugins (**OPC-UA** OR **MQTT**) gathers the data and sends this input data to both **InfluxDB** and **Time Series Analytics Microservice**.

#### **Data Storage**

**InfluxDB** stores the incoming data from **Telegraf**.

#### **Data Processing**

**Time Series Analytics Microservice** uses the User Defined Function (UDF) deployment package
(TICK Scripts, UDFs, Models) from the sample apps. The UDF deployment package for the Wind
Turbine Anomaly Detection sample app is available in [this folder](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/tree/main/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-time-series/apps/wind-turbine-anomaly-detection/time-series-analytics-config).

Directory details is as below:

##### **`config.json`**

The `task` section defines the settings for the Kapacitor task and User-Defined Functions (UDFs).

| Key                     | Description                                                                                     | Example Value                          |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `udfs`                  | Configuration for the User-Defined Functions (UDFs).                                           | See below for details.                 |

**UDFs Configuration**:

The `udfs` section specifies the details of the UDFs used in the task.

| Key     | Description                                                                                 | Example Value                          |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `name`  | The name of the UDF script.                                                                 | `"windturbine_anomaly_detector"`       |
| `models`| The name of the model file used by the UDF.                                                 | `"windturbine_anomaly_detector.pkl"`   |
| `device`| Specifies the hardware `CPU` or `GPU` for executing the UDF model inference.Default is `cpu`| `cpu`                                  |

> **Note:** The maximum allowed size for `config.json` is 5 KB.
---

**Alerts Configuration**:

The `alerts` section defines the settings for alert mechanisms, using the MQTT protocol by
default.
For publishing OPC-UA alerts in Docker, refer to [Docker OPC-UA Alerts](../how-to-guides/how-to-configure-alerts.md#docker---publish-opc-ua-alerts).
For OPC-UA Alerts in Helm, refer to [Helm OPC-UA Alerts](../how-to-guides/how-to-configure-alerts.md#helm---publish-opc-ua-alerts)
> **Note:** Enable only one type of alerts: either MQTT or OPC-UA.

**MQTT Configuration**:

The `mqtt` section specifies the MQTT broker details for sending alerts.

| Key                 | Description                                                                 | Example Value          |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|

| `mqtt_broker_port`  | The port number of the MQTT broker.                                         | `1883`                |

##### **`udfs/`**

Contains the Python script to process the incoming data.
Uses Random Forest Regressor and Linear Regression machine learning algos accelerated with
[Intel® Extension for Scikit-learn*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/scikit-learn.html)
to run on CPU/GPU to detect the anomalous power generation data points relative to wind speed.

##### **`tick_scripts/`**

The TICKScript `windturbine_anomaly_detector.tick` determines processing of the input data
coming in. The file contains the details on execution of the UDF file, storage of processed data and publishing of alerts.
By default, it is configured to publish the alerts to **MQTT**.

##### **`models/`**

The `windturbine_anomaly_detector.pkl` is a model built using the Random Forest Regressor
algorithm from the Scikit-learn library.
For more details on how it is built refer to the [README](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/main/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-time-series/apps/wind-turbine-anomaly-detection/training/README.md).
