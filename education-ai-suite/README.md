**Education AI Suite** is currently a preview release! A formal release will follow shortly.

The **Education AI Suite** is a preview collection of education-focused AI applications, libraries, and benchmarking tools to help developers build solutions faster. It provides pipelines and models optimized with the OpenVINO™ toolkit for accelerated performance on Intel® CPUs, integrated GPUs, and NPUs.

This suite organizes workflows and capabilities tailored for the education sector, with initial support for the **Smart Classroom** application. **Smart Classroom** is a modular, extensible framework designed to process and summarize educational content using advanced AI models. It helps transform raw classroom recordings into concise, structured summaries for students, educators, and learning platforms.
The main features are as follows:

-	Audio transcription with ASR models (e.g., Whisper, Paraformer)
-	Summarization using powerful LLMs (e.g., Qwen, LLaMA)
-	Plug-and-play architecture for integrating new ASR and LLM models
-	API-first design ready for frontend integration
- Extensible roadmap for real-time streaming, diarization, translation, and video analysis
