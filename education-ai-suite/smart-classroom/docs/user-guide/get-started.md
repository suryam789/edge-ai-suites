# Get Started with Smart Classroom

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use **Windows PowerShell** (not Command Prompt/CMD) for all steps in this guide.
> PowerShell scripts (`.ps1` files) will not execute in CMD — they will only open as text files.

There are two ways to run Smart Classroom. Both use the same services, models and
configurations.

| | [Desktop app](#desktop-app) (recommended) | [PowerShell scripts](#alternative-powershell-scripts-and-the-browser-ui) |
|---|---|---|
| Commands to run | `.\start-desktop-app.ps1` | `.\setup-smart-classroom.ps1`, then `.\start-smart-classroom.ps1` |
| Prerequisites and installs | **Setup** screen, one item at a time | One scripted pass through everything |
| Settings | **Configuration** screen | Console prompts, then editing `config.yaml` by hand |
| Services | **Services** screen: start, stop, restart, live logs | Separate console windows |
| Where the UI runs | Its own desktop window | Browser at <http://localhost:5173> |

Whichever you pick, start by cloning the repository.

## Clone the Repository

Go to the target directory of your choice and clone the suite.
If you want to clone a specific release branch, replace `main` with the desired tag.
To learn more on partial cloning, check the [Repository Cloning guide](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/OEP-articles/contribution-guide.html#repository-cloning-partial-cloning).

```bash
  git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse --branch main https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git
  cd edge-ai-suites
  git sparse-checkout set education-ai-suite
  cd education-ai-suite/smart-classroom
```

## Desktop App

The desktop app covers setup, configuration and running the services in one window.

### Step 1: Launch the App

```powershell
.\start-desktop-app.ps1
```

The script asks for your proxy settings, installs Node.js through winget if it is
missing, builds the UI and hands over. The app then supervises the Python services
itself.

**Optional parameters:**

- `-Dev` — Run the Vite dev server with hot reload
- `-NoAutoStart` — Open the app without starting the backend automatically
- `-SkipNodeInstall` — Fail instead of installing Node.js when it is missing
- `-Silent` — Skip the proxy prompts and use the saved `.proxy-config`

### Step 2: Work Through the Setup Screen

**Get started** opens first and lists what is still missing. Follow its links, or open
**Setup** directly, and work down the list:

| Section | Covers |
|---------|--------|
| **System and drivers** | Operating system, processor, memory, free disk space, Intel GPU and NPU drivers, Windows long paths |
| **Software and environment** | Python 3.12, Node.js, FFmpeg, DL Streamer, the Python environment, and the grading conversion environment and layout detection model |

Each row shows what was found and what it blocks. Rows the app can fix have a button:
**Install** for Python, FFmpeg and DL Streamer, **Create** for the Python environment,
**Prepare** for the layout detection model. **Fix _n_ items** at the top runs everything
outstanding in order. Progress appears in the **Output** pane below, and **Copy
diagnostics** puts the whole list on the clipboard for a bug report.

> [!NOTE]
> Creating the Python environment downloads several gigabytes, and preparing
> the layout detection model downloads and converts it. Both take a while on a first run.

The backend cannot start until the Python environment exists.

### Step 3: Review the Settings

**Get started** shows the settings most people change. The **Configuration** screen has
the full list from `config.yaml`, `runtime_config.yaml` and `.proxy-config`, grouped and
searchable. Saving a change while the services are running offers a restart.

> [!NOTE]
> Speaker diarization (identifying who is speaking) is optional and requires a
> one-time Hugging Face access token. The **Get started** screen flags this when
> diarization is enabled without a token; set it under **Configuration**, or see
> [Speaker Diarization Setup](advance-setup-guide.md#f-speaker-diarization-setup-optional).

### Step 4: Use the App

The backend starts automatically once setup is complete, unless you passed
`-NoAutoStart`.

| Screen | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Get started** | Overview of what is ready, what is missing, and the settings most people change |
| **Setup** | Prerequisite checks plus the Python environment and model preparation |
| **Configuration** | Edit `config.yaml`, `runtime_config.yaml` and `.proxy-config` |
| **Services** | Start / stop / restart the backend and watch live logs for it and every child service |

## Alternative: PowerShell Scripts and the Browser UI

Use this path for unattended installs or when you want the services in visible console
windows.

### Step 1: Run the Setup Script (First-Time Only)

```powershell
.\setup-smart-classroom.ps1
```

> [!NOTE]
> If all prerequisites are already installed (FFmpeg, DL Streamer, Python
> dependencies), you can skip setup and go straight to `.\start-smart-classroom.ps1`.

The setup script will:

1. **[1] Check System Requirements**
   - OS version, CPU, RAM, storage
   - Python and Node.js versions

2. **[2] Application Dependency Check**
   - FFmpeg (auto-install if missing)
   - DL Streamer (auto-download and run installer [`dlstreamer-2026.1.0-win64.exe`](advance-setup-guide.md#b-install-dl-streamer))

3. **[3] Configure Settings**
   - [3.1] Feature Configuration (enable/disable individual application features)
   - [3.2] Language & ASR Configuration (provider, model, device)
   - [3.3] Upload Size Limits
   - [3.4] OCR Configuration
   - [3.5] Board OCR Configuration
   - [3.6] Grading Configuration (enable/disable Smart Grading)

> [!NOTE]
> Speaker diarization (identifying who is speaking) is optional and requires a one-time
> Hugging Face access token setup if enabled — see
> [Speaker Diarization Setup](advance-setup-guide.md#f-speaker-diarization-setup-optional).

### Step 2: Start the Services

Use the start script for subsequent runs, or after modifying `config.yaml`:

```powershell
.\start-smart-classroom.ps1
```

**Optional parameters:**

- `-Electron` - Shortcut for `.\start-desktop-app.ps1` (see [Desktop App](#desktop-app))
- `-Silent` - Unattended mode for CI/Ansible (skips all prompts, auto-restarts services)
- `-NoElevate` - Skip admin privilege elevation (use when already running as administrator)
- `-NoWindowsTerminal` - Use Invoke-WmiMethod instead of Windows Terminal (for remote sessions/Ansible)

```powershell
# Example: Automated deployment
.\start-smart-classroom.ps1 -Silent -NoElevate -NoWindowsTerminal
```

The startup script performs:

- **Service Detection** - Checks running services
- **Restart Options** - Restart, skip, or abort choices (auto in `-Silent` mode)
- **Proxy Configuration** - Loads from `.proxy-config`
- **Sequential Launch** - Backend -> Content Search -> Grading (if enabled) -> Frontend
- **Graceful Shutdown** - `Q` to stop all, `E` to keep running (auto-exits in `-Silent` mode)

### Step 3: Open the UI

Once all services are running, open your browser:

- **Local:** <http://localhost:5173>
- **Network:** <http://YOUR_IP:5173>

## Automated Setup - Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during automated setup, refer to the manual steps below:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `PSSecurityException` when running `.ps1` scripts | Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` in PowerShell |
| FFmpeg installation fails | See [Manual Step 1A](advance-setup-guide.md#a-install-ffmpeg-required-for-audio-processing) |
| DL Streamer download fails | See [Manual Step 1B](advance-setup-guide.md#b-install-dl-streamer) |
| Python dependencies fail | See [Manual Step 1D](advance-setup-guide.md#d-install-python-dependencies) |
| Content Search fails | See [Manual Step 4](advance-setup-guide.md#step-4-set-up-content-search) |
| Frontend fails to start | See [Manual Step 6](advance-setup-guide.md#step-6-bring-up-the-frontend) |

## Service Ports Reference

| Service | Port | Health Check |
|---------|------|--------------|
| Backend | 8000 | <http://localhost:8000/health> |
| Content Search | 9011 | <http://localhost:9011/api/v1/system/health> (200 only when ChromaDB, file ingest and video preprocess are ready too; 503 while any is starting) |
| Layout Detection | 9902 | <http://localhost:9902/health> |
| Grading | 9012 | <http://localhost:9012/api/v1/health> |
| Frontend | 5173 | <http://localhost:5173> |

> [!NOTE]
> Layout Detection and Grading services only start when `grading.enabled: true` in `config.yaml`.
> The desktop app is its own frontend and does not use port 5173.
