# System Requirements

## Hardware Requirements

- Intel® GPU recommended; CPU fallback supported
- For Panther Lake `xe` GPU telemetry, install `xpu-smi` on the host before running
  `./setup.sh`
- Host install example on Ubuntu OS version 24.04 when the Intel graphics repository
  or PPA is already configured:
  `sudo apt install xpu-smi`
- If the GPU name still appears as a raw Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) ID
  after host package install, refresh the host PCI ID database with:
  `sudo update-pciids`

## Software Requirements

- Docker Engine
- Docker Compose tool
- Python 3 programming language
- OpenSSL toolkit
- jq tool
- Install the Git Large File Storage (LFS) extension **before** cloning, for video file storage:

  git lfs install
  ```
