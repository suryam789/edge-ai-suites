# iRobot Create 3 Wandering tutorial

This tutorial presents the Wandering application running on an
iRobot Create 3 mobile robotics platform extended with an Intel®
compute board, an Intel® RealSense™ camera and a Slamtec RPLIDAR 2D lidar sensor.

The tutorial uses the Intel® RealSense™ camera and the Slamtec RPLIDAR 2D
lidar sensor for both mapping with RTAB-Map and navigation with Nav2.
For navigation, Intel®
[ground floor segmentation](../../../../dev_guide/tutorials_amr/perception/pointcloud-groundfloor-segmentation.md)
is used for segmenting ground level and remove it from the Intel® RealSense™
camera pointcloud.

Watch the video for a demonstration of the iRobot Create 3 navigating
in a testing playground:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Assemble your robotic kit following the instructions for [irobot-create3](../../developer_kit/irobot-create3-robot.md)
- Complete the [get started guide](../../../../gsg_robot/index.md) before continuing.

### Intel® board connected to iRobot Create 3

Follow the instructions on page
[iRobot® Create® 3 - Network Recommendations](https://iroboteducation.github.io/create3_docs/setup/network-config/)
to set up an Ethernet over USB connection and to configure the network
device on the Intel® board.
Use an IP address of the same subnet as used on the iRobot Create 3.

Check that the iRobot Create 3 is reachable over the Ethernet
connection. Output on the robot with the configuration from the image
above:

```bash
$ ping -c 3 192.168.99.2
PING 192.168.99.2 (192.168.99.2) 56(84) bytes of data.

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.989/2.105/2.308/0.144 ms
```

Install the `ros-jazzy-wandering-irobot-tutorial` package on the
Intel® board connected to the robot.

<!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
<!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

```bash
apt install ros-jazzy-wandering-irobot-tutorial
```

<!--hide_directive:::

<!--hide_directive:sync: humblehide_directive-->

```bash

```

Start the discovery server in a new terminal:

```bash
fastdds discovery --server-id 0
```

In a new terminal set the environment variables for ROS 2 to use the
discovery server:

```bash
export ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER=127.0.0.1:11811
export ROS_SUPER_CLIENT=true
unset ROS_DOMAIN_ID
```

Check that the setup is correct by listing the ROS 2 topics provided
by the robot:

```bash
ros2 topic list
```

The iRobot Create 3 topics should be listed:

```bash
/parameter_events
/robot2/battery_state
/robot2/cliff_intensity
/robot2/cmd_audio
/robot2/cmd_lightring
/robot2/cmd_vel
...
/robot2/tf
/robot2/tf_static
/robot2/wheel_status
/robot2/wheel_ticks
/robot2/wheel_vels
/rosout
```

> **Note**:
> If only `/parameter_events` and `/rosout` topics are listed then
> the communication between the robot and the Intel® board is not working. Check
> the [iRobot Create 3 mobile robotics platform documentation](https://iroboteducation.github.io/create3_docs/)
> to troubleshoot the issue.

Start the tutorial using its launch file; provide the namespace set on
the robot in the argument `irobot_ns`:

```bash
ros2 launch wandering_irobot_tutorial wandering_irobot.launch.py irobot_ns:=/robot2
```

To use `ros2 cli` utilities, e.g. `ros2 topic`, `ros2 node`, set the
environment variables above before running the commands.
