The Smart Classroom project is a modular, extensible framework designed to process and summarize educational content using advanced AI models. It supports transcription, summarization, and future capabilities like video understanding and real-time analysis.

The main features are as follows:

- **Audio file processing and transcription** with ASR models (e.g., Whisper, Paraformer)
- **Summarization** using powerful LLMs (e.g., Qwen, LLaMA)
- **Plug-and-play architecture** for integrating new ASR and LLM models
- **API-first design** ready for frontend integration
- Ready-to-extend for real-time streaming, diarization, translation, and video analysis
