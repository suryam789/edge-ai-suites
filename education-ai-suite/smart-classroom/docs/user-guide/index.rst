Smart Classroom
============================================
The Smart Classroom project is a modular, extensible framework designed to process and summarize educational content using advanced AI models. It supports transcription, summarization, and future capabilities like video understanding and real-time analysis.

The main features are as follows:

- **Audio transcription** with ASR models (e.g., Whisper, Paraformer)  
-  **Summarization** using powerful LLMs (e.g., Qwen, LLaMA)  
-  **Plug-and-play architecture** for integrating new ASR and LLM models  
-  **API-first design** ready for frontend integration  
-  **Extensible roadmap** for real-time streaming, diarization, translation, and video analysis
