# Power Profiles User Guide

## Overview

Intel® Core™ Ultra edge nodes can be tuned to trade sustained performance
against heat, fan noise, and energy use. The Infrastructure software ships a
set of local power-tuning tools that let you:

- Apply a ready-made **power profile** (`LowPower` … `MaxPerformance`).
- Set an explicit **package (PkgWatt)** and optional **platform (SysWatt)** cap.
- **Monitor** live power and package temperature.
- **Stress** the CPU and integrated GPU to validate a profile under load.

> **On the target system:** the commands below use repository-relative paths
> (`tools/power-tuning/…`), which work when you run them from the repo root. On a
> host provisioned with Infrastructure software, the same tools are available on
> the target system at `/opt/edge/developer/tools/power-tuning/`. Either
> `cd /opt/edge/developer` and use the relative paths as written, or prefix each
> command with the full path (e.g.
> `sudo /opt/edge/developer/tools/power-tuning/set_power_profile.sh --list`).

All tuning is enforced through Intel RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) and the
Intel Low Power Mode daemon (`intel_lpmd`). These two layers behave differently
across a reboot:

- The **RAPL power cap** (the PL1/PL2 wattage limits) is programmed into volatile
  CPU registers and **reverts automatically on reboot** to firmware defaults.
  This is the main enforcement and the built-in safety net. The **thermald
  profile also acts on these limits**: applying the profile initializes
  thermald's RAPL cooling device and reconfigures the effective power limit from
  the PPCC value embedded in the thermal profile.
- The **`intel_lpmd` config file** is written to disk, so it **persists across a
  reboot** and is re-read by the daemon on the next boot. To undo the daemon-side
  tuning you must restore the config (see
  [What persists across a reboot](#what-persists-across-a-reboot)).

> [!NOTE]
> These tools are tuned for Intel Panther Lake (Core Ultra). On other
> Intel silicon they still run, but the Config-TDP (cTDP) levels and the
> platform (psys/SysWatt) domain may differ or be unavailable.

## Prerequisites

- An Intel `x86_64` host (Panther Lake recommended).
- A CPU frequency governor can conflict with `intel_lpmd`. The `performance` and
  `ondemand` governors override the daemon's low-power intent, so either switch
  to `powersave` — which cooperates with `intel_lpmd` — or disable the governor
  service altogether:

  ```bash
  # Option 1: switch to the powersave governor
  echo powersave | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

  # Option 2: disable the governor service
  sudo systemctl disable --now powersave.service
  ```

- Linux ships several competing power-management daemons. Stop and disable any
  that are running — for example `tlp`, `tuned`, `cpufreqd`, or `ondemand` — so
  they will conflict with `intel_lpmd` for control of CPU power and frequency.
- BIOS settings that hand CPU power/frequency control to the OS. The power
  limits and EPP/EPB tuning only take effect when the OS (not firmware) owns
  these controls — verify them **before** applying a profile, or the script may
  succeed while the limits are silently ignored.
  Setting names and menu paths vary by vendor. See the **BIOS Settings**
  sections in [set-power-profile skill](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-node-infrastructure-blueprint/blob/main/skills/set-power-profile/SKILL.md)
  for the full mandatory list plus optional settings (e.g. disabling firmware
  DBPM, unlocking the power-limit MSRs, and *Config Base Power* / cTDP). `sudo` access. The power scripts read/write MSRs and restart a system service,
  so they re-run themselves with `sudo`.
- `msr` kernel module and `msr-tools` (`rdmsr` / `wrmsr`) — required to read the
  cTDP levels and program the RAPL MSRs:

  ```bash
  sudo modprobe msr
  sudo apt-get install -y msr-tools
  ```

- `turbostat` for monitoring (from the matching `linux-tools` package):

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install -y linux-tools-$(uname -r)
  ```

- `stress-ng` for load generation:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install -y stress-ng
  ```


## Power Profiles

A profile is a package-power (PkgWatt) budget plus a default burst ratio. The
package cap is enforceable on every platform; on silicon that also exposes the
psys (SysWatt) domain, a matching whole-platform cap is added automatically.

> [!NOTE]
> The table below is a reference recommendation. The values can be
> overridden with command-line parameters (e.g. `--pkgWatt`, `--sysWatt`,
> `--burstRatio`, `--pl1Tau`) for further tuning — see
> [Set an Explicit Power Envelope](#set-an-explicit-power-envelope).

| Profile | PkgWatt budget | Default burst ratio | Typical use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LowPower` | 10 W | 1.25 | Fanless / battery, mostly idle (kiosk, signage, sensor) |
| `BalancedLow` | 15 W | 1.25 | Light interactive (basic UI, browsing) |
| `BalancedHigh` | 20 W | 1.18 | Interactive / mixed workloads |
| `Performance` | 25 W | 1.19 | Steady general compute |
| `MaxPerformance` | platform max (cTDP Level 2) | 1.18 | Sustained heavy compute (AI inference, transcode, builds) |
| `Custom` | (none) | (none) | Explicit `--pkgWatt` / `--sysWatt` / `--burstRatio` values |

### Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| PkgWatt | Package power — the CPU cores plus the integrated GPU. The main limit these tools set. |
| SysWatt | Platform power — the whole board (package plus memory, VRs, other rails). Exposed by the RAPL psys domain. **Not available on all systems:** many Core Ultra platforms do not expose a psys domain at all (any `--sysWatt` is then ignored and only the PkgWatt cap applies), and on some silicon the counter is present but frozen, so it reads `0.00`. Use PkgWatt as the reliable effective figure. |
| PL1 | Power Limit 1 — the **sustained** power allowed over the long term. |
| PL2 | Power Limit 2 — the **short burst** power the chip may briefly reach. `PL2 = PkgWatt × burst_ratio`. |
| burst_ratio | The multiplier that sets the burst limit (PL2) relative to the sustained limit (PL1): `PL2 = PkgWatt × burst_ratio`. It controls how much extra power the chip may draw for short spikes before settling back to the sustained budget. `1.0` means no burst (PL2 = PL1, flat power); `1.25` allows bursts 25% above sustained (e.g. a 20 W PkgWatt budget bursts to 25 W). Higher values feel snappier under sudden load; lower values give flatter, more predictable power and temperature. |
| tau (PL1 tau) | Time window (seconds) over which PL1 is averaged — how long a burst can last before settling to PL1. |
| cTDP Level 2 | Configurable TDP — the highest sustained power the silicon supports (the maximum you can request). |

## Apply a Named Profile

Use `set_power_profile.sh` with `--profile`. Run from the repository root.
On the target system, the tools are available at `/opt/edge/developer/tools/power-tuning/` —
either `cd /opt/edge/developer` and use the relative paths as written, or prefix
each command with the full path (e.g.
`sudo /opt/edge/developer/tools/power-tuning/set_power_profile.sh --profile LowPower`):

```bash
# List the available profiles and their PkgWatt budgets
tools/power-tuning/set_power_profile.sh --list

# Longest battery / coolest, silent operation
sudo tools/power-tuning/set_power_profile.sh --profile LowPower

# Balanced interactive use
sudo tools/power-tuning/set_power_profile.sh --profile BalancedHigh

# Max sustained throughput (AI inference / transcode / builds)
sudo tools/power-tuning/set_power_profile.sh --profile MaxPerformance

# Override the default burst ratio for a snappier feel
sudo tools/power-tuning/set_power_profile.sh --profile Performance --burstRatio 1.4

# Profile PkgWatt with an explicit SysWatt cap (psys-capable platforms only)
sudo tools/power-tuning/set_power_profile.sh --profile Performance --sysWatt 35

# Preview only — resolve and print the plan without changing anything
tools/power-tuning/set_power_profile.sh --profile Performance --dry-run
```

> **`--sysWatt` is not honored on every platform.** The SysWatt cap only takes
> effect on silicon that exposes the RAPL psys domain. On platforms without it,
> `--sysWatt` is silently ignored and only the PkgWatt cap is enforced; on
> platforms where the psys counter is present but frozen, the cap is written but
> `turbostat` still reads a fixed value (`SysWatt = 0.00`, or any other constant
> that never changes with load). In both cases PkgWatt is the reliable effective
> figure. The `--dry-run` output reports whether psys is supported on this host.

## Set an Explicit Power Envelope

For fine-grained control, set the package (and optionally platform) watts
directly instead of a named profile.

```bash
# Sustained 20 W with the default 1.25 burst ratio (PL2 = 25 W)
sudo tools/power-tuning/set_power_profile.sh --pkgWatt 20

# Strict cap — no burst (PL1 = PL2 = 30 W)
sudo tools/power-tuning/set_power_profile.sh --pkgWatt 30 --burstRatio 1.0

# Independent platform cap: PkgWatt 25 W, SysWatt 35 W
sudo tools/power-tuning/set_power_profile.sh --pkgWatt 25 --sysWatt 35

# Custom PL1 time window (tau) of 10 s
sudo tools/power-tuning/set_power_profile.sh --pkgWatt 15 --pl1Tau 10
```

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--pkgWatt W` | Package PL1 (sustained) target. Clamped to `[0.125 W, cTDP Level 2]` and snapped to the RAPL power-unit granularity (0.125 W). Default: Nominal TDP. |
| `--sysWatt W` | psys/platform (SysWatt) cap. Applied only on platforms that expose the psys domain; ignored otherwise. Default: same as PkgWatt. |
| `--burstRatio R` | Burst ratio (`>= 1.0`). `PL2 = pkgWatt × R`, clamped to cTDP Level 2. Also biases EPP/EPB toward performance. |
| `--pl1Tau S` | PL1 time window in seconds (default `28`). |
| `--dry-run` | Resolve and print the plan without applying anything. |
| `--list` | List available profiles and exit. |

## Monitor Power and Temperature

> [!NOTE]
> `pt_mon.sh` is provided as a *reference* monitor. You can use it,
> or any other power-monitoring tool you prefer (e.g. `turbostat`, `powertop`,
> `intel_gpu_top`, a BMC/OEM utility, or reading
> `/sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl*`). The power profile and stress steps are
> independent of which monitor you choose.

Watch package temperature and the RAPL power domains live with `pt_mon.sh`
(wraps `turbostat`). It samples every 2 s and tees to `pt_mon.txt`:

```bash
cd tools/power-tuning
sudo ./pt_mon.sh
```

For a custom interval, duration, or log path, run `turbostat` directly with the
same columns:

```bash
sudo turbostat -S --interval 1 --num_iterations 60 \
  --show PkgTmp,PkgWatt,CorWatt,GFXWatt,RAMWatt,SysWatt \
  | tee pt_mon.txt
```

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PkgTmp` | CPU package temperature (°C). |
| `PkgWatt` | Whole-package power (cores + iGPU + uncore) — the most reliable effective figure. |
| `CorWatt` | CPU cores portion of the package. |
| `GFXWatt` | Integrated GPU (graphics) portion. |
| `RAMWatt` | DRAM/memory RAPL domain. |
| `SysWatt` | Platform (psys) power; reads `0.00` when the counter is frozen or absent. |

## Stress the Platform Under Load

> [!NOTE]
> `stress_gen.sh` provides a *simulated* load for evaluation purposes.
> You can use it, or run the **actual workload** you want to evaluate — apply the
> power profile, start the monitor, and drive the platform with either the
> simulated stress below or your real application. The monitor reacts the same
> way to either.

Validate a profile or cap under real load with `stress_gen.sh` (wraps
`stress-ng`). No `sudo` needed — it runs as the current user:

```bash
# All CPUs at 100% + 12 iGPU workers, until Ctrl-C
tools/power-tuning/stress_gen.sh

# 4 CPU workers at 80%, no GPU load, for 2 minutes
tools/power-tuning/stress_gen.sh --cpus 4 --load 80 --gpu 0 --duration 2m

# CPU + iGPU burn-in for 5 minutes
tools/power-tuning/stress_gen.sh --gpu 8 --duration 5m
```

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--cpus N` | Number of CPU workers, `1..nproc` (default: all CPUs). |
| `--load P` | Per-CPU load percentage, `1..100` (default `100`). |
| `--gpu N` | Number of stress-ng iGPU worker processes, `0..12` (default `4`; `0` disables GPU load). This is a worker count, not a GPU count. Use a maximum of `4` for a 4 Xe-core iGPU and `8` for a 12 Xe-core iGPU. |
| `--duration D` | Run time in stress-ng syntax (`60s`, `5m`, `2h`); omit to run until stopped. |

Stop a running stress test with `Ctrl-C`, or:

```bash
sudo pkill -x stress-ng
```

### Real AI inference load with `openvino_stress.sh`

For a load that resembles a production edge workload rather than a synthetic one,
`openvino_stress.sh` drives the CPU, GPU, or NPU with OpenVINO `benchmark_app`
running in a container (K3s pod or Docker, auto-detected). This is useful for
measuring throughput-per-watt and for thermal qualification with a real
neural-network compute pattern:

```bash
# 120 s of CPU inference load
tools/power-tuning/openvino_stress.sh --device cpu --duration 120

# 5 min of GPU inference load
tools/power-tuning/openvino_stress.sh --device gpu --duration 300

# NPU inference for a fixed number of iterations
tools/power-tuning/openvino_stress.sh --device npu --niter 500000

# Stop and remove any running benchmark containers/pods
tools/power-tuning/openvino_stress.sh --cleanup
```

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--device cpu\|gpu\|npu` | Target accelerator (default `cpu`). |
| `--runtime k3s\|docker` | Container runtime (default: auto-detect). |
| `--niter N` | Iteration count; `0` = time-based (default `0`). |
| `--duration D` | Run time in seconds when `niter=0` (default `60`). |
| `--api sync\|async` | Inference API mode (default `sync`). |
| `--cleanup` | Stop and remove running benchmark containers/pods. |

The default model is downloaded automatically on first run; override the model,
image, or thread count with `--model`, `--image`, and `--nthreads`.

## Recommended Workflow

To validate a power profile end to end, use three terminals:

1. **Apply** the profile:

   ```bash
   sudo tools/power-tuning/set_power_profile.sh --profile Performance
   ```

2. **Monitor** power and temperature:

   ```bash
   cd tools/power-tuning && sudo ./pt_mon.sh
   ```

3. **Stress** the platform and watch the monitor react:

   ```bash
   tools/power-tuning/stress_gen.sh --duration 3m
   ```

   `stress_gen.sh` is a simulated load; substitute the real workload you want to
   evaluate here if you prefer — for example a real AI inference load with
   `tools/power-tuning/openvino_stress.sh --device gpu --duration 3m`.

Step up one profile at a time until throughput stops improving or the package
temperature approaches the throttle point.

## Side Effects and Tips

- **Thermals & acoustics:** higher profiles raise package temperature and fan
  noise; lower profiles run cooler and quieter (or fanless).
- **Throttling:** if cooling can't keep up, the firmware clamps sustained power
  below the target. The script reports the effective (enforced) value and notes
  when firmware clamped PL1.
- **`SysWatt = 0.00`:** on some Core Ultra silicon the psys counter is frozen.
  The cap is still written, but turbostat can't observe it — use PkgWatt as the
  effective figure. This is a firmware limitation, not a failure.
- **Brief management gap:** applying a profile restarts `intel_lpmd.service`
  (~2 s) during which the daemon isn't actively managing CPU states.
- **Partial revert on reboot:** the RAPL power cap resets to firmware defaults
  on reboot, but the `intel_lpmd` config on disk does not — see below.

## What Persists Across a Reboot

The script changes two independent things with different lifetimes:

| What changes | Where it lives | Reverts on reboot? |
|---|---|---|
| RAPL cap (PL1/PL2 watts) | Volatile CPU RAPL MSRs (`0x610`/`0x65C`) + powercap sysfs | **Yes** — firmware re-initializes these on every boot. |
| `intel_lpmd` config (EPP/EPB, ITMT, active CPUs) | `intel_lpmd_config.xml` on disk (and any model-specific file it overrides) | **No** — the file stays on disk and `intel_lpmd` re-reads it at the next boot. |

So on reboot `intel_lpmd` **re-uses the config file the script wrote** (assuming
`intel_lpmd.service` is enabled at boot); the daemon-side tuning is not undone by
a reboot — only the wattage cap is.

To restore the stock daemon behavior, put the original config back. The script
saves a one-time `.orig` backup of any model-specific file it overrides (e.g.
`intel_lpmd_config_F6_M204.xml` on Panther Lake):

```bash
sudo cp -a /usr/local/etc/intel_lpmd/intel_lpmd_config_F6_M204.xml.orig \
           /usr/local/etc/intel_lpmd/intel_lpmd_config_F6_M204.xml
sudo systemctl restart intel_lpmd.service
```

> [!NOTE]
> Only overridden *model-specific* files get an `.orig` backup. The
> generic `intel_lpmd_config.xml` the script writes has no backup if no config
> existed there before.

## Related Agent Skills

The same tools are also driven by agent skills (see
[AI Agent Integration](agent-skills.md)):

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `set-power-profile` | Apply a named power profile or set an explicit PkgWatt / SysWatt envelope. |
| `monitor-power-thermal` | Run the live power/thermal monitor. |
| `generate-platform-stress` | Generate configurable CPU / iGPU load. |

These power skills run **directly on the target host** — they read/write the
CPU's RAPL MSRs and restart `intel_lpmd`, which must happen locally on the node.
To drive them by natural language on a provisioned node, install an agent CLI on
the target host and open it in the developer source tree (`/opt/edge/developer`),
where the `skills/` directory and `tools/power-tuning/` scripts already live.

### Using the skill on the Target Host

Launch the agent from the developer source tree so it can discover the
skills and scripts:

```bash
cd /opt/edge/developer
copilot # or any other agent CLI which you installed and logged-in
```

From there, prompt in natural language — e.g. *"switch this node to the
Performance power profile"* or *"stress all CPUs for 3 minutes and monitor
power"* — and the agent runs the matching skill against the local
`tools/power-tuning/` scripts.
