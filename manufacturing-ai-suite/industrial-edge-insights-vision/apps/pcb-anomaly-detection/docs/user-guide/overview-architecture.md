# Overview and Architecture

This Sample Application enables real-time anomaly detection in printed circuit boards (PCB) by running inference workflows across multiple AI models. It connects multiple video streams from different cameras to AI-powered pipelines, all operating efficiently on a single industrial PC. This solution improves PCB production and compliance by anomalies before they can impact operations.
