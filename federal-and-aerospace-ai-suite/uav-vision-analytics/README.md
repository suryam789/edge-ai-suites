# UAV Vision Analytics Application

The UAV Vision Analytics application is an AI-powered UAV object detection application with live telemetry overlay, optimized for Intel® edge hardware. It processes video from a UAV-mounted camera (or a simulated video file), runs YOLO11s inference across 80 object classes, and overlays correlated MAVLink telemetry (GPS, altitude, speed, heading) on the output RTSP stream. The stream is consumable by any capable client, such as QGroundControl (QGC), VLC, and ffplay.

The application is built on Intel DL Streamer Pipeline Server and supports two deployment modes: a self-contained **Standalone (pymavlink)** mode using Gazebo/PX4 Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) simulation, and a **UAV Mission Compute SDK** mode that integrates with a running instance of the UAV Mission Compute SDK for full mission control and multi-camera pipeline management. Both modes are deployed on top of the Edge Node Infrastructure software - an edge computing platform, which enables hardware acceleration capabilities. See [Infrastructure Setup](docs/user-guide/infrastructure-setup.md) for build and provisioning steps.

## Stack

### Standalone Mode (pymavlink)

| Service | Image | Role |
|---------|-------|------|
| `broker` | `eclipse-mosquitto:2.0.22` | MQTT broker for telemetry and pipeline events |
| `px4` | `px4io/px4-sitl:latest` | PX4 SITL flight controller simulation |
| `mavlink-router` | Built from `uav-mission-compute-sdk/infra/px4-sim/mavlink-router` | Routes MAVLink telemetry between PX4 and the pipeline server |
| `dlstreamer-pipeline-server` | `intel/dlstreamer-pipeline-server:2026.2.0-ubuntu24` (+ `pymavlink`) | Core inference engine — YOLO11s detection and telemetry overlay |
| `metrics-manager` | `intel/metrics-manager:2026.2.0` | Host platform (CPU/GPU) metrics |
| `nginx` | `nginx:1.27-alpine` | Reverse proxy — the only service that publishes ports to the host |

All services share the `app_network` Docker network and are defined in [`docker-compose-pymavlink.yml`](docker-compose-pymavlink.yml). Only `nginx` publishes ports to the host; `dlstreamer-pipeline-server` and `metrics-manager` are reachable exclusively through it.

### UAV Mission Compute SDK Mode

| Service | Image | Role |
|---------|-------|------|
| `dlstreamer-pipeline-server` | `intel/dlstreamer-pipeline-server:2026.2.0-ubuntu24` | Core inference engine — YOLO11s detection and telemetry overlay; connects to an externally running UAV Mission Compute SDK stack |
| `nginx` | `nginx:1.27-alpine` | Reverse proxy — the only service that publishes ports to the host |

Defined in [`docker-compose-uavsdk.yml`](docker-compose-uavsdk.yml). Requires the
`edge-ai-suites/federal-and-aerospace-ai-suite/uav-mission-compute-sdk` stack to be running first. Only `nginx` publishes ports to the host; `dlstreamer-pipeline-server` is reachable exclusively through it.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| Docker Engine release 24 or later | [Install guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) |
| Docker Compose v2 | Included with Docker Desktop; on Linux OS, install the `docker-compose-plugin` package. Use `docker compose` (space), not `docker-compose` (hyphen). |
| Intel® GPU with OpenVINO support | Required for `GPU_DEVICE` / `GPU_RENDER_DEVICE` in `.env`. |
| Python 3 with `venv` | Required by `make model` to create a Python virtual environment for exporting YOLO11s. |
| Intel® NPU (optional) | For NPU-accelerated pipelines; falls back to `/dev/null` (disabled) if not detected. |
| USB or RealSense camera (optional) | For live-camera pipelines; auto-detected by `make init`. |

Run `make init` after cloning to create `.env` from `.env.example`, auto-detect the host IP (`HOST_IP`), and auto-detect GPU, NPU, and camera device paths.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Download the model

```bash
cd uav-vision-analytics
make model
```

This creates a Python virtual environment, downloads YOLO11s, and exports it to OpenVINO FP16 format under `resources/models/yolo11s/`.

### Step 2: Start a deployment mode

**Standalone Mode (pymavlink)** — self-contained, no external dependencies:

```bash
make pymav-up
```

**UAV Mission Compute SDK Mode** — requires the UAV Mission Compute SDK stack running first:

```bash
make uavsdk-up
```

### Step 3: Start RTSP pipelines

```bash
make start-rtsp DEVICE=gpu   # or cpu | npu | all
```

## Endpoints

All HTTP(S) traffic is served through the nginx reverse proxy on port 443 (HTTPS,
self-signed cert; plain HTTP on port 80 redirects to HTTPS. `dlstreamer-pipeline-server`
and `metrics-manager` no longer publish ports directly to the host.

| Service | URL / Path | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| DL Streamer Pipeline Server REST API | `https://<HOST_IP>/` | Pipeline control and status, proxied to `dlstreamer-pipeline-server:8081` |
| RTSP annotated stream | `rtsp://<HOST_IP>:8555` | Detection + telemetry overlay output; TCP passthrough via nginx `stream {}` |
| Metrics manager SSE stream (Standalone mode only) | `https://<HOST_IP>/metrics/stream` | Host platform (CPU/GPU) metrics, proxied to `metrics-manager:9090` |
| Metrics manager REST snapshot (Standalone mode only) | `https://<HOST_IP>/api/v1/metrics/latest` | Host platform (CPU/GPU) metrics, proxied to `metrics-manager:9090` |

`<HOST_IP>` is auto-detected and written to `.env` by `make init` (defaults to `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` when run locally). The self-signed TLS certificate is generated automatically into `configs/nginx/ssl/` the first time `make pymav-up`/`make uavsdk-up` runs — use `curl -k` to skip verification.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `nginx`'s ports (`80`, `443`, `8555`) are published on `HOST_IP`, so they are reachable
> from your LAN by default (needed for QGroundControl/VLC/ffplay on other devices) — not
> just `localhost`. RTSP traffic is unencrypted, and neither the REST API nor the RTSP
> stream is authenticated. Set `HOST_IP=127.0.0.1` in `.env` to restrict access to the
> local host only.

```
