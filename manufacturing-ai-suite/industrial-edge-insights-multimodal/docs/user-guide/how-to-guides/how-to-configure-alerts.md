# Configure Alerts in Time Series Analytics Microservice

This section provides instructions for setting up alerts in **Time Series Analytics Microservice**.

## Docker Compose Deployment

### Docker - Publish MQTT Alerts

#### Configure MQTT Alerts

By default, the following MQTT alerts are configured in the
`edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal/configs/time-series-analytics-microservice/config.json` file.

```json
  "alerts": {
      "mqtt": {
          "mqtt_broker_host": "ia-mqtt-broker",
          "mqtt_broker_port": 1883,
          "name": "my_mqtt_broker"
      }
   }
 ```

#### Configure MQTT Alert in TICK Script

The following snippet shows how to add the MQTT if not
already added. By default, the `edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal/configs/time-series-analytics-microservice/tick_scripts/weld_anomaly_detector.tick` TICK Script has the following configuration.

```bash
data0
        |alert()
                .crit(lambda: "anomaly_status" > 0)
                .message('{"time": "{{ index .Time }}", "Pressure": {{ index .Fields "Pressure" }}, "CO2 Weld Flow": {{ index .Fields "CO2 Weld Flow" }}, "anomaly_status": {{ index .Fields "anomaly_status" }} } ')
                .noRecoveries()
                .mqtt('my_mqtt_broker')
                .topic('alerts/weld_defect_detection')
                .qos(1)
```

> **Note:** Setting **QoS** to `1` ensures messages are delivered at least once. Alerts are preserved and resent if the MQTT broker reconnects after downtime.

### Docker - Subscribe to MQTT Alerts

Follow the steps to subscribe to the published MQTT alerts.

To subscribe to all MQTT topics, execute the following command:

```sh
docker exec -ti ia-mqtt-broker mosquitto_sub -h localhost -v -t '#' -p 1883
```

#### Docker - Subscribing to Time Series Analytics Microservice Alerts

```sh
docker exec -ti ia-mqtt-broker mosquitto_sub -h localhost -v -t alerts/weld_defect_detection -p 1883
```

#### Docker - Subscribing to DL Streamer Pipeline Server Results

```sh
docker exec -ti ia-mqtt-broker mosquitto_sub -h localhost -v -t vision_weld_defect_classification -p 1883
```

#### Docker - Subscribing to Fusion Analytics Results

```sh
docker exec -ti ia-mqtt-broker mosquitto_sub -h localhost -v -t fusion/anomaly_detection_results -p 1883
```

## Helm Deployment

### Helm - Publish MQTT Alerts

For detailed instructions on configuring and publishing MQTT alerts, refer to the [Publish MQTT Alerts](#docker---publish-mqtt-alerts) section.

### Helm - Subscribe to MQTT Alerts

Follow the steps to subscribe to the published MQTT alerts.

To subscribe to MQTT topics in a Helm deployment, execute the following command:

- Identify the MQTT broker pod name by running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n multimodal-sample-app | grep mqtt-broker
```

- Use the pod name from the output of the above command to subscribe to all topics:
```bash
kubectl exec -it -n multimodal-sample-app <mqtt_broker_pod_name> -- mosquitto_sub -h localhost -v -t '#' -p 1883
```

#### Helm - Subscribing to Time Series Analytics Microservice Alerts

```bash
kubectl exec -it -n multimodal-sample-app <mqtt_broker_pod_name> -- mosquitto_sub -h localhost -v -t alerts/weld_defect_detection -p 1883
```

#### Helm - Subscribing to DL Streamer Pipeline Server Results

```bash
kubectl exec -it -n multimodal-sample-app <mqtt_broker_pod_name> -- mosquitto_sub -h localhost -v -t vision_weld_defect_classification -p 1883
```

#### Helm - Subscribing to Fusion Analytics Results

```bash
kubectl exec -it -n multimodal-sample-app <mqtt_broker_pod_name> -- mosquitto_sub -h localhost -v -t fusion/anomaly_detection_results -p 1883
```
