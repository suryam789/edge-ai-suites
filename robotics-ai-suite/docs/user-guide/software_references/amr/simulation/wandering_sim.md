# Simulating `wandering`

In this software reference, you'll simulate the `wandering` pipeline in Gazebo. This pipeline is built of multiple components available in the Robotics AI Suite, showcasing how to simulate a complex perception and navigation workload.

`wandering` is a fully-autonomous mobile robot application that navigates an unknown environment, creating an occupancy grid map and choosing unexplored frontiers while avoiding obstacles, all without human intervention. It combines RGB-D depth camera sensing, multi-sensor point cloud fusion, fast 3D clustering obstacle perception with ADBScan, SLAM mapping, and Nav2 navigation.

## Architecture

The simulation pipeline connects sensor streaming, perception, SLAM, costmap layer integration, navigation, and autonomous exploration:

### Data Flow & Component Roles

1. **Sensors & Input**: The composed TurtleBot3 Waffle RGB-D robot model simulates both a 2D planar LiDAR (`/scan`) and a generic RGB-D depth camera publishing color images, depth images, camera info, and depth point clouds (`/camera/depth/color/points`).
2. **Sensor Fusion (`adbscan_sensor_fusion`)**: The `adbscan_pointcloud_fusion` node time-synchronizes planar scan and 3D depth point clouds, transforms them into the `base_link` frame, combines and voxel-downsamples them, and publishes `/adbscan/points`.
3. **3D Obstacle Perception (`adbscan_ros2`)**: The ADBSCAN clustering node runs 3D density-based spatial clustering on `/adbscan/points` and publishes object-sized 3D bounding obstacles to `/obstacle_array`.
4. **SLAM & Mapping**: RTAB-Map (`slam_backend:=rtabmap`, default) performs visual RGB-D mapping and localization, publishing the `/map` topic and `map` $\rightarrow$ `odom` transform. Alternatively, SLAM Toolbox (`slam_backend:=slam_toolbox`) can be selected for 2D LiDAR SLAM.
5. **Nav2 Costmap Integration (`nav2_adbscan_layer`)**: The custom `ADBScanLayer` plugin integrates with Nav2's global and local costmaps. For each detection in `/obstacle_array`, it marks a lethal circular obstacle region with configurable padding and timeout expiration. Standard obstacle and inflation layers run alongside it.
6. **Autonomous Frontier Exploration (`wandering_app`)**: The `wandering_mapper` node inspects the global costmap for free, unexplored frontier boundaries and issues `NavigateToPose` action goals to Nav2.

## Components

- `wandering_bringup`: Launch orchestration, Gazebo model spawner, ROS-Gazebo sensor bridge, and RViz configurations.
- `adbscan_sensor_fusion`: Multi-sensor point cloud fusion and voxel downsampling.
- `adbscan_ros2`: Fast 3D point cloud clustering node producing `/obstacle_array`.
- `nav2_adbscan_layer`: Custom Nav2 costmap plugin (`ADBScanLayer`) marking detected obstacles.
- `rtabmap_ros` / `slam_toolbox`: Visual RGB-D SLAM or 2D LiDAR SLAM backends.
- Nav2: Upstream path planning, controller, and recovery server.
- `wandering_app`: Autonomous frontier exploration node and RViz Wandering Control panel.

### Launch the Simulation

By default, graphical Gazebo client rendering (`gui:=false`) is disabled to save system resources, while the physics simulation and sensor pipelines are executed in the backend by the Gazebo server (`gz-server`). If you wish to open the graphical Gazebo window alongside RViz, pass `gui:=true`.

Execute the command below to start the autonomous simulation pipeline:

```bash
ros2 launch wandering_bringup wandering_sim.launch.py gui:=true
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, `gui` is set to `false` in `wandering_sim.launch.py`. The Gazebo simulation continues running headlessly in the backend via Gazebo server, significantly reducing GPU and CPU resource overhead while RViz handles visualization. Omit `gui:=true` when running on resource-constrained systems, headless test nodes, or automated benchmarks.

**What this starts:**

1. **Gazebo Sim with composed RGB-D Waffle**: Starts the backend Gazebo server world and spawns the TurtleBot3 Waffle equipped with an RGB-D camera payload (`gui:=true` optionally opens the graphical Gazebo client window).
2. **RGB-D Sensor Bridge**: Translates simulated camera color, depth, camera info, and depth point cloud streams to ROS 2 topics.
3. **SLAM & Nav2**: Starts RTAB-Map SLAM (or SLAM Toolbox) alongside Nav2 configured with `ADBScanLayer` in both local and global costmaps.
4. **ADBSCAN 3D Perception**: Fuses point cloud data and clusters obstacles into `/obstacle_array`.
5. **Frontier Exploration (`wandering_app`)**: Evaluates costmap frontiers and sends `NavigateToPose` goals to Nav2.
6. **Visualization**:
   - Global map RViz window with the **Wandering Control** panel.
   - Local costmap RViz window displaying real-time obstacle layers.
   - `rqt_image_view` window displaying the camera color feed.

**Expected output:**

When `gui:=true` is specified, the Gazebo simulation environment opens:

![gazebo_waffle](images/gazebo_waffle.png)

RViz displays the mapped area, costmaps, and robot position:

![wandering-gazebo-rviz2](images/wandering-gazebo-rviz2.png)

To enhance simulation performance when the Gazebo GUI is running, set the real-time update rate in Gazebo:

1. In Gazebo's left panel, go to the **World** tab and select **Physics**.
2. Set the **Real Time Update Rate** to `0`.

To stop the simulation, press `Ctrl-c` in the terminal where the launch command is executing.

### Interactive Manual Override in Simulation & Nav2 Waypointing

The simulation environment supports the same interactive operator control and Nav2 goal selection as physical hardware:

- **Switching to Manual Mode via RViz**: While the autonomous exploration pipeline is active, click **Manual mode** in the RViz **Wandering Control** panel. This immediately pauses autonomous frontier exploration and cancels any active `NavigateToPose` exploration goal.
- **Nav2 Single-Goal Waypointing**: Select the **Nav2 Goal** (or **2D Goal Pose**) tool in the RViz top toolbar. Click and drag on the map to define both the target position and desired heading orientation ($\theta$). Nav2 plans a collision-free path to the destination while actively avoiding both static obstacles and dynamic obstacles detected by the `ADBScanLayer`.
- **Nav2 Multi-Waypoint Follow Mode**: You can also use Nav2's **Waypoint / Route Mode** in RViz to queue a sequence of inspection waypoints. Click **Waypoint mode** in the Nav2 panel, use the Nav2 Goal tool to place multiple consecutive poses across the environment, and click **Start Navigation** to execute the multi-stop route.
- **Resuming Autonomous Wandering**: Click **Autonomous mode** in the **Wandering Control** panel at any time to hand control back to `wandering_app`, which resumes evaluating unexplored frontiers and navigating toward them.
- **Starting Directly in Manual Mode**: To launch the simulation with mapping, ADBSCAN perception, and Nav2 costmap protection active, but without initiating autonomous frontier exploration, pass `start_wandering:=false`:

  ```bash
  ros2 launch wandering_bringup wandering_sim.launch.py start_wandering:=false gui:=true
  ```

### Selecting a SLAM Backend

By default, the simulation uses RTAB-Map for visual RGB-D SLAM. To use SLAM Toolbox (2D LiDAR SLAM) instead:

```bash
ros2 launch wandering_bringup wandering_sim.launch.py \
  slam_backend:=slam_toolbox gui:=true
```

### Headless Execution

To run the simulation in headless mode without the Gazebo graphical window (the default launch behavior):

```bash
ros2 launch wandering_bringup wandering_sim.launch.py
```

This runs the Gazebo server in the backend to manage physics and sensor generation without the rendering overhead of the Gazebo GUI client. You can also pass `use_rviz:=false` if running on purely headless servers or automated CI pipelines:

```bash
ros2 launch wandering_bringup wandering_sim.launch.py use_rviz:=false
```

### Velocity Message Conventions

The simulation launch file handles command velocity stamping automatically:

- **Jazzy + Gazebo Harmonic**: Uses `geometry_msgs/msg/TwistStamped` (`enable_stamped_cmd_vel: true`).
- **Humble + Gazebo Classic**: Uses `geometry_msgs/msg/Twist` (`enable_stamped_cmd_vel: false`).

### Troubleshooting

#### 1. Simulation Stutter or Low Real-Time Factor

- **Symptom**: Low simulation frame rate or high host CPU/GPU load.
- **Remedy**:
  - Run the simulation in headless/server-only mode by omitting `gui:=true` (the default behavior).
  - In Gazebo's left panel, go to **World** $\rightarrow$ **Physics** and set **Real Time Update Rate** to `0`.
  - Ensure Intel GPU hardware acceleration is configured according to the [Getting Started](../../../platform_foundation/getting_started.md) guide.

#### 2. Robot Remains Stationary

- **Symptom**: Nodes launch successfully, but the simulated robot does not drive toward exploration goals.
- **Root Cause**: Simulation clock is not advancing, or velocity stamping mismatch.
- **Verification**:
  ```bash
  ros2 topic hz /clock
  ros2 topic hz /cmd_vel
  ```
- **Remedy**: Ensure Gazebo physics is playing (click the Play button in Gazebo GUI if paused). If custom parameters are supplied, ensure `use_sim_time: true` is configured on all Nav2 and application nodes, and check velocity stamping (`TwistStamped` on Jazzy vs. `Twist` on Humble).

#### 3. Verifying Sensor Data Streams

If costmaps do not update, confirm that the Gazebo RGB-D sensor bridge is streaming data to ROS 2 topics:

```bash
ros2 topic hz /scan
ros2 topic hz /camera/color/image_raw
ros2 topic hz /camera/depth/color/points
ros2 topic hz /adbscan/points
ros2 topic echo /obstacle_array --once
```
