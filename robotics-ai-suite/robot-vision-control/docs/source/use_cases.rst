Exemplary Use Cases
##############################

Two exemplary use cases are provided within the RVC framework, each designed to demonstrate distinct capabilities of perception and motion control.

- :ref:`dynamic_use_case`: The vision system tracks the positions of four different object classes in motion, enabling the robot to intercept and grasp one while it is still moving.

- :ref:`static_use_case`: The vision system detects the pose of a stationary object, allowing the robot to align its gripper and perform an orientation-aware pick operation.
